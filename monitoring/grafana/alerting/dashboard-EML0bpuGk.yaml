      message: InfluxDB not reachable for too long. The means the rest of the monitoring
        is currently broken. Check `systemctl status influxdb.service` on the monitoring
        host. InfluxDB is supposed to respond to HTTP requests on port 8086, use e.g.
        `curl http://localhost:8086/query` on the monitoring host to verify whether
        it responds.
